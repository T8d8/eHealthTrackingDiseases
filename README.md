The eHealth Tracking Diseases

Description:  The eHealth Tracking Disease is a web application that will be used in order to track diseases, to observe the disease over time, to monitor the evolution of widespreads and dangerous diseases such as Ebola, Cholera, polio,etc . 
Based on symptoms that we gather from patients, and according to  a form that they  respond to. The app will tell them by appoximation the disease they may have and also, the first precautions they need to take. The app will help  also localized certified and dedicated hospitals in the nearby (using geolocalization).  It can also send  emergency call, in case of emergency. For exemples, SOS poison, SOS pregnancy, etc.
Furthermore, the application will help take decisions based on data processing by the app. For instance, if there is a lot of similar symptoms in a same localized area, for a short period of time (many people are infected at the same time)Â ; therefore the app will discover the location of the infectious diseases or new diseases, turn it to an  epidemic disease (raise a red flag), raise the level of awareness and keep tracking it. It will send alerts and  notifications to  health institutions, hospitals, clinicians, government,  etc.
The app will also help health institutions in case of emergency  to find the focal point, in order for them to provide the first cares in an optimized way.
The app will also help tourists comming in Africa, to get the latest news about sanitary and unsanitary and precautions to take. And also to check if they vaccinations are up to date.
Like in the name of the application, the main purpose for this app is to track diseases.
